    "# While Loop in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "A `while` loop in Python is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a given condition is `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Syntax\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while condition:\n",
    "    # Code to execute\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 1: Basic While Loop\n",
    "```python\n",
    "count = 1\n",
    "while count <= 5:\n",
    "    print(\"Count:\", count)\n",
    "    count += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 2: Using `break`\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 0\n",
    "while x < 10:\n",
    "    if x == 5:\n",
    "        break  # Exits the loop when x is 5\n",
    "    print(x)\n",
    "    x += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 3: Using `continue`\n",
    "```python\n",
    "y = 0\n",
    "while y < 5:\n",
    "    y += 1\n",
    "    if y == 3:\n",
    "        continue  # Skips the rest of the loop when y is 3\n",
    "    print(y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 4: Infinite Loop\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while True:\n",
    "    print(\"This will run forever! Use Ctrl+C to stop.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 5: Loop with Else\n",
    "```python\n",
    "i = 1\n",
    "while i <= 3:\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "    i += 1\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Loop finished!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The `while` loop is useful when the number of iterations is not known beforehand. It continues execution until a specified condition becomes `False`.\n",
    "\n"
