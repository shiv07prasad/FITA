    "# Try, Except, Finally in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Error handling in Python is done using `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks. These help prevent program crashes by handling exceptions gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Syntax\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that may raise an exception\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "except ExceptionType:\n",
    "    # Code to handle the exception\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    # Code that will always execute, whether an exception occurs or not\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 1: Handling an Exception\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    x = 10 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    print(\"Execution complete.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Cannot divide by zero!\n",
    "Execution complete.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 2: Handling Multiple Exceptions\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "    result = 10 / num\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"Error: Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    print(\"Process finished.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 3: Finally Block Always Executes\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    print(\"Opening file...\")\n",
    "    file = open(\"sample.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "    print(\"File not found!\")\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    print(\"Closing file...\")\n",
    "    file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "### Exercise 1: Handle Division by Zero\n",
    "**Task:** Write a program that takes two numbers as input and performs division. Handle `ZeroDivisionError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    a = int(input(\"Enter numerator: \"))\n",
    "    b = int(input(\"Enter denominator: \"))\n",
    "    print(\"Result:\", a / b)\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    print(\"Execution complete.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 2: Handle FileNotFoundError\n",
    "**Task:** Write a program to open a file and read its content. Handle `FileNotFoundError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    file = open(\"nonexistent.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "    print(file.read())\n",
    "except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "    print(\"File not found!\")\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    print(\"Attempt to read file complete.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 3: Handle Multiple Exceptions\n",
    "**Task:** Write a program that takes user input, converts it to an integer, and performs division. Handle `ValueError` and `ZeroDivisionError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "    print(\"Result:\", 100 / num)\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"Invalid input! Please enter a number.\")\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    print(\"End of program.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The `finally` block is useful for cleanup operations like closing files or releasing resources. It ensures that important tasks are completed, even if an exception occurs.\n",
