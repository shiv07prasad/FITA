    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Multi-threading in Python allows concurrent execution of tasks, making programs more efficient, especially for I/O-bound operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating Threads in Python\n",
    "Python's `threading` module provides tools to create and manage threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: Creating a Simple Thread\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "counter = 0\n",
    "def print_counter():\n",
    "    global counter\n",
    "    for i in range(2000):\n",
    "            counter += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(counter)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a thread\n",
    "thread = threading.Thread(target=print_counter)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Starting the thread\n",
    "thread.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Waiting for the thread to finish\n",
    "thread.join()\n",

    "## Using Multiple Threads\n",
    "We can create multiple threads to execute different tasks simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating Multiple Threads in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Hereâ€™s a super simple example of creating multiple threads in Python using the `threading` module:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "counter = 0\n",
    "def print_counter():\n",
    "    global counter\n",
    "    for i in range(2000):\n",
    "            counter += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(counter)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create two threads\n",
    "thread1 = threading.Thread(target=print_counter)\n",
    "thread2 = threading.Thread(target=print_counter)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Start the threads\n",
    "thread1.start()\n",
    "thread2.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Wait for both threads to finish\n",
    "thread1.join()\n",
    "thread2.join()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Final count: {counter}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Whatâ€™s Happening?\n",
    "- We define a function `print_numbers()` that prints numbers from 0 to 4.\n",
    "- We create two threads (`thread1` and `thread2`), both running the same function.\n",
    "- We start both threads with `.start()`, allowing them to run concurrently.\n",
    "- We wait for both threads to complete using `.join()`, so the program doesnâ€™t exit prematurely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Super easy, right? ðŸš€\n",
    "\n",
    "## Thread Synchronization\n",
    "Threads may access shared resources, leading to race conditions. The `Lock` mechanism helps prevent such issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 3: Using Locks for Thread Safety\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "counter = 0\n",
    "lock = threading.Lock()\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_counter():\n",
    "    global counter\n",
    "    for i in range(2000):\n",
    "        with lock:\n",
    "            counter += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(counter)\n",

    "print(\"Final counter value:\", counter)\n",

    "## Thread Pools\n",
    "Thread pools manage a fixed number of worker threads, distributing tasks efficiently.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Multi-threading in Python is useful for running multiple tasks concurrently, especially in I/O-bound programs. However, proper synchronization techniques must be applied when accessing shared resources to prevent race conditions. Locks, semaphores, event objects, and thread pools help ensure safe and efficient multi-threading.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `multiprocessing` module allows true parallel execution of CPU-bound tasks by creating separate processes. Using process pools makes it easier to manage and distribute workloads efficiently.\n",
