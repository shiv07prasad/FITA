    "## Introduction\n",
    "A nested `if` statement is an `if` statement inside another `if` statement. It allows for more complex decision-making by checking multiple conditions sequentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Syntax\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition1:\n",
    "    if condition2:\n",
    "        # Execute this block if both conditions are True\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        # Execute this block if condition1 is True but condition2 is False\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # Execute this block if condition1 is False\n",
