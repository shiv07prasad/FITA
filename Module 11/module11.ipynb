    "# Iterators in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an Iterator?\n",
    "An iterator in Python is an object that contains a countable number of values and can be iterated upon, meaning that you can traverse through all the values. It implements two methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__iter__()`: Returns the iterator object itself.\n",
    "- `__next__()`: Returns the next value from the iterator.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example of an Iterator\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyNumbers:\n",
    "    def __iter__(self):\n",
    "        self.a = 1\n",
    "        return self\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def __next__(self):\n",
    "        if self.a <= 5:\n",
    "            x = self.a\n",
    "            self.a += 1\n",
    "            return x\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            raise StopIteration\n",
    "\n",
    "my_iter = MyNumbers()\n",
    "my_iterator = iter(my_iter)\n",
    "\n",
    "for num in my_iterator:\n",
    "    print(num)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Built-in Iterators\n",
    "Python has built-in iterators, such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "my_iter = iter(my_list)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(next(my_iter))  # Output: 1\n",
    "print(next(my_iter))  # Output: 2\n",
    "print(next(my_iter))  # Output: 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using `iter()` with `next()`\n",
    "The `iter()` function creates an iterator, and `next()` retrieves the next value.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [10, 20, 30]\n",
    "it = iter(numbers)\n",
    "print(next(it))  # Output: 10\n",
    "print(next(it))  # Output: 20\n",
    "print(next(it))  # Output: 30\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Difference Between Iterator and Iterable\n",
    "- An **iterable** is an object that can return an iterator (e.g., lists, tuples, dictionaries).\n",
    "- An **iterator** is an object that represents a stream of data and returns elements one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "my_iterator = iter(my_list)  # Convert iterable to iterator\n",
    "print(next(my_iterator))  # Output: 1\n",

    "**Task:** Convert a string into an iterator and print each character using `next()`.\n",

    "**Solution:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_string = \"Hello\"\n",
    "my_iter = iter(my_string)\n",

    "tuple_items = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")\n",

    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Iterators provide a powerful way to iterate through sequences in Python efficiently. Custom iterators can be created using classes with `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods, while built-in iterators make iteration easy over common data structures.\n",

    "# Generators in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Generator?\n",
    "A generator in Python is a special type of iterator that allows you to iterate over values one at a time without storing them in memory. Generators are useful when working with large datasets or streams of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Create a Generator\n",
    "A generator is defined using a function that contains the `yield` keyword instead of `return`. This allows the function to pause and resume execution while maintaining its state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_generator():\n",
    "    yield 1\n",
    "    yield 2\n",
    "    yield 3\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the generator\n",
    "gen = my_generator()\n",
    "print(next(gen))  # Output: 1\n",
    "print(next(gen))  # Output: 2\n",
    "print(next(gen))  # Output: 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Difference Between `return` and `yield`\n",
    "- `return` terminates a function and returns a single value.\n",
    "- `yield` pauses the function, saves its state, and allows resumption from the last `yield` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Iterating Over a Generator\n",
    "Generators can be iterated using a `for` loop or manually with `next()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def count_up_to(n):\n",
    "    count = 1\n",
    "    while count <= n:\n",
    "        yield count\n",
    "        count += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the generator\n",
    "for number in count_up_to(5):\n",
    "    print(number)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "3\n",
    "4\n",
    "5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generator Expressions\n",
    "Generators can also be created using a concise expression similar to list comprehensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "gen_exp = (x * x for x in range(5))\n",
    "print(next(gen_exp))  # Output: 0\n",
    "print(next(gen_exp))  # Output: 1\n",
    "print(next(gen_exp))  # Output: 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages of Generators\n",
    "- **Memory Efficient**: No need to store all values in memory.\n",
    "- **Lazy Evaluation**: Generates values only when needed.\n",
    "- **Improves Performance**: Useful for handling large data sets efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Generators are an excellent way to manage memory efficiently and iterate over large data sets. They use `yield` instead of `return` and can be iterated lazily using `next()` or a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises for Generators\n",
    "### Exercise 1: Create a Generator for Even Numbers\n",
    "**Task:** Write a generator function that yields even numbers up to a given limit.\n",
