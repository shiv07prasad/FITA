    "# Encapsulation and Inheritance in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Encapsulation\n",
    "Encapsulation is the process of restricting access to certain details of an object and only exposing necessary parts. This is done using private and protected attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Encapsulation\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name       # Public attribute\n",
    "        self.__age = age       # Private attribute (Encapsulation)\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_age(self):  # Public method to access private data\n",
    "        return self.__age  \n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a person\n",
    "p = Person(\"Alice\", 25)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing public attribute\n",
    "print(p.name)  # ‚úÖ Works\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing private attribute directly (Won't work)\n",
    "print(p.__age)  # ‚ùå AttributeError\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing private attribute through a method (Encapsulation)\n",
    "print(p.get_age())  # ‚úÖ Works\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessing Private Attributes\n",
    "Private attributes are prefixed with `__`, meaning they cannot be accessed directly.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(account.__balance)  # AttributeError: 'BankAccount' object has no attribute '__balance'\n",
    "```\n",
    "However, they can be accessed using name mangling:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(account._BankAccount__balance)  # Output: 1300\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inheritance\n",
    "Inheritance allows one class (child class) to inherit properties and behavior from another class (parent class).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Inheritance\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Parent class\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name  # Common feature for all animals\n",
    "\n",
    "# Child classes inherit from Animal\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"Woof!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"Meow!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Bird(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"Chirp!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating objects\n",
    "dog1 = Dog(\"Buddy\")\n",
    "cat1 = Cat(\"Whiskers\")\n",
    "bird1 = Bird(\"Tweety\")\n",
    "\n",
    "print(dog1.name, \"-\", dog1.speak())  # Buddy - Woof!\n",
    "print(cat1.name, \"-\", cat1.speak())  # Whiskers - Meow!\n",
    "print(bird1.name, \"-\", bird1.speak())  # Tweety - Chirp!\n",
    "\n",

    "## Types of Inheritance\n",
    "1. **Single Inheritance** - One class inherits from another.\n",
    "2. **Multiple Inheritance** - A class inherits from multiple parent classes.\n",
    "3. **Multilevel Inheritance** - A child class inherits from another child class.\n",
    "4. **Hierarchical Inheritance** - Multiple classes inherit from a single parent class.\n",
    "5. **Hybrid Inheritance** - A combination of two or more types of inheritance.\n",

    "## Easy Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation:** Create a class `Employee` with private attributes `name` and `salary`. Add methods to set and get these attributes.\n",
    "2. **Inheritance:** Define a class `Vehicle` with an attribute `max_speed`. Create a subclass `Car` that inherits from `Vehicle` and adds an attribute `brand`.\n",
    "3. **Private Method:** Create a class `Computer` with a private method `_show_specs()`. Add a public method to call this private method.\n",
    "4. **Multilevel Inheritance:** Define a class `Animal`. Create a subclass `Mammal` and another subclass `Dog` that inherits from `Mammal`. Add methods to each class and demonstrate inheritance.\n",
    "5. **Class Attribute in Inheritance:** Modify the `Dog` class to include a class attribute `species` and access it from an object.\n",
