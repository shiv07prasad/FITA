    "# Indentation in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Indentation?\n",
    "Indentation in Python refers to **the spaces or tabs at the beginning of a line** that define the structure and hierarchy of the code. Unlike other programming languages that use curly braces `{}` to define blocks of code, Python relies entirely on indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why is Indentation Important?\n",
    "- **Mandatory**: Python uses indentation to determine the structure of code blocks.\n",
    "- **Readability**: It improves code readability and consistency.\n",
    "- **Syntax Errors**: Incorrect indentation leads to `IndentationError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Rules of Indentation\n",
    "1. **Use consistent spaces or tabs** (spaces are recommended).\n",
    "2. **Indent blocks under loops, conditions, functions, and classes**.\n",
    "3. **Recommended indentation**: Use 4 spaces per indentation level.\n",
    "4. **Never mix spaces and tabs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples of Indentation\n",
