    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Created by **Guido van Rossum** in 1991, Python emphasizes code clarity, making it an excellent choice for beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features of Python:\n",
    "- **Easy to Learn & Use** – Python's syntax is simple and resembles plain English.  \n",
    "- **Interpreted Language** – Code runs line-by-line, making debugging easier.  \n",
    "- **Dynamically Typed** – No need to declare variable types explicitly.  \n",
    "- **Extensive Libraries** – Comes with built-in modules for tasks like data analysis, web development, and automation.  \n",
    "- **Cross-Platform** – Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux without modification.  \n",
    "- **Versatile** – Used in web development, machine learning, automation, game development, and more.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Python’s philosophy, summed up in **The Zen of Python** (`import this`), promotes simplicity and readability, making it a great first language for programming. 🚀\n"

    "# Python 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3 was released on **December 3, 2008**. 🚀  \n",
    "\n",
    "It introduced major improvements over Python 2, including:  \n",
    "- **Better Unicode support** 📝  \n",
    "- **Improved syntax** (e.g., `print(\"Hello, World!\")` instead of `print \"Hello, World!\"`)  \n",
    "- **Removal of outdated features**  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, Python 3 was **not backward compatible** with Python 2, meaning older Python 2 code often needed modifications to work in Python 3.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The last version of Python 2 (**Python 2.7**) was officially discontinued on **January 1, 2020**. 🎉  \n"

    "# What is Unicode Support?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unicode support** in Python means that the language can handle characters from **all writing systems** in the world, not just English. This allows Python to work with **multiple languages, symbols, and emojis** seamlessly. 🌍✨  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Why is Unicode Important?\n",
    "- **Supports global languages** (e.g., English, हिंदी, 中文, عربى, 日本語).  \n",
    "- **Handles special symbols** (e.g., €, £, ₹, ∑, π).  \n",
    "- **Allows emojis in code and text** (e.g., 😀🔥🎉).  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Unicode in Python\n",
    "- **Python 2:** Strings were ASCII by default (`\"hello\"` was an ASCII string).  \n",
    "- **Python 3:** Strings are **Unicode by default** (`\"hello\"` is now a Unicode string).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "text = \"こんにちは\"  # Japanese for \"Hello\"\n",

    "# Data Types in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has several built-in **data types** that define the kind of values a variable can hold. Here are the main ones:  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣ Numeric Types  \n",
    "- **`int`** → Whole numbers (e.g., `10`, `-5`, `1000`)  \n",
    "- **`float`** → Decimal numbers (e.g., `3.14`, `-0.99`, `2.0`)  \n",
    "- **`complex`** → Complex numbers (e.g., `2 + 3j`, `5 - 7j`)  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2️⃣ Text Type  \n",
    "- **`str`** → Strings (e.g., `\"Hello\"`, `'Python'`, `\"😊\"`)  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 3️⃣ Sequence Types  \n",
    "- **`list`** → Ordered, mutable collection (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`, `[\"apple\", \"banana\"]`)  \n",
    "- **`tuple`** → Ordered, immutable collection (e.g., `(10, 20, 30)`, `(\"a\", \"b\")`)  \n",
    "- **`range`** → Sequence of numbers (e.g., `range(5)` → `0, 1, 2, 3, 4`)  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 4️⃣ Set Types  \n",
    "- **`set`** → Unordered, unique items (e.g., `{1, 2, 3}`, `{\"apple\", \"banana\"}`)  \n",
    "- **`frozenset`** → Immutable set (e.g., `frozenset({1, 2, 3})`)  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 5️⃣ Mapping Type  \n",
    "- **`dict`** → Key-value pairs (e.g., `{\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 25}`)  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 6️⃣ Boolean Type  \n",
    "- **`bool`** → Represents `True` or `False`  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 7️⃣ Binary Types  \n",
    "- **`bytes`** → Immutable sequence of bytes (e.g., `b\"hello\"`)  \n",
    "- **`bytearray`** → Mutable sequence of bytes  \n",
    "- **`memoryview`** → Memory view of another object  \n",

    "# Variables in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "A **variable** is a name that stores a value in Python. Unlike some languages, **Python does not require explicit type declarations**—it determines the type automatically.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1⃣ Declaring Variables\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 10         # Integer\n",
    "name = \"Alex\"  # String\n",
    "pi = 3.14      # Float\n",
    "is_active = True  # Boolean\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2⃣ Rules for Variable Names\n",
    "✔️ Must start with a **letter (A-Z, a-z) or an underscore (_)**  \n",
    "✔️ Can contain **letters, numbers (0-9), and underscores**  \n",
    "❌ **Cannot start with a number**  \n",
    "❌ **Cannot use Python keywords** (`if`, `else`, `while`, etc.)  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Valid Variable Names:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "age = 25\n",
    "_name = \"Alice\"\n",
    "user1 = \"John\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Invalid Variable Names:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "1name = \"Alex\"   # ❌ Cannot start with a number\n",
    "if = 10          # ❌ \"if\" is a keyword\n",
    "user-name = \"Sam\" # ❌ Hyphens are not allowed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3⃣ Variable Reassignment\n",
    "Python allows changing the type of a variable dynamically:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 10   # Integer\n",
    "x = \"Hello\"  # Now it's a string\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4⃣ Multiple Assignments\n",
    "You can assign multiple variables in one line:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a, b, c = 1, 2, 3\n",
    "print(a, b, c)  # 1 2 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5⃣ Constants in Python\n",
    "Python **does not have true constants**, but by convention, variables meant to stay constant are written in **uppercase**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "PI = 3.14159\n",
    "GRAVITY = 9.81\n",
