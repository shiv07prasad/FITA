    "# File Handling in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "File handling in Python allows us to create, read, write, and manipulate files stored on disk. Python provides built-in functions to work with different file types, including text files and binary files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Writing and Reading Text Files\n",
    "Python provides the `open()` function to work with text files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing to a Text File\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Open a file in write mode\n",
    "with open(\"example.txt\", \"w\") as file:\n",
    "    file.write(\"Hello, this is a test file.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading from a Text File\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Open a file in read mode\n",
    "with open(\"example.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inserting lines\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(\"example.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    lines = file.readlines()  # Read all lines into a list\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert at index 2 (this becomes the 3rd line when counting from 1)\n",
    "lines.insert(2, \"This line is inserted in the middle!\\n\")\n",
    "\n",
    "with open(\"example.txt\", \"w\") as file:\n",
    "    file.writelines(lines)  # Write all lines back to the file\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Writing Binary Files Manually\n",
    "Binary files store data in a non-text format, such as images, audio, or serialized objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing a Binary File\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Writing binary data\n",
    "with open(\"binary_file.bin\", \"wb\") as file:\n",
    "    file.write(b\"\\x41\\x42\\x43\")  # Writing bytes ABC\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading a Binary File\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Reading binary data\n",
    "with open(\"binary_file.bin\", \"rb\") as file:\n",
    "    data = file.read()\n",
    "    print(data)  # Output: b'ABC'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Pickle to Write and Read Binary Files\n",
    "The `pickle` module allows us to serialize and deserialize Python objects into binary format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing an Object to a Binary File with Pickle\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pickle\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data to be serialized\n",
    "data = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 25, \"city\": \"New York\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Writing to a binary file\n",
    "with open(\"data.pkl\", \"wb\") as file:\n",
    "    pickle.dump(data, file)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading an Object from a Binary File with Pickle\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pickle\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reading from a binary file\n",
    "with open(\"data.pkl\", \"rb\") as file:\n",
    "    loaded_data = pickle.load(file)\n",
    "    print(loaded_data)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "File handling in Python is essential for storing and retrieving data efficiently. While text files are useful for human-readable content, binary files store raw data, making them ideal for non-text information. The `pickle` module provides an easy way to serialize and deserialize Python objects for storage and transfer.\n",
