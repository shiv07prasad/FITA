    "# Understanding Relational Databases and the Role of SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Relational databases are a fundamental part of modern data management, allowing structured storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data. SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language used to interact with relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Relational Database?\n",
    "A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into tables, which consist of rows and columns. Each table represents an entity, and relationships between entities are established using keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts of Relational Databases:\n",
    "1. **Tables** - Data is stored in tables with rows (records) and columns (fields).\n",
    "2. **Primary Key** - A unique identifier for each record in a table.\n",
    "3. **Foreign Key** - A field in one table that references a primary key in another table.\n",
    "4. **Normalization** - A process to organize data efficiently and minimize redundancy.\n",
    "5. **ACID Properties** - Ensures database transactions are reliable:\n",
    "   - **Atomicity** - Transactions are all-or-nothing.\n",
    "   - **Consistency** - Ensures data integrity.\n",
    "   - **Isolation** - Transactions do not interfere with each other.\n",
    "   - **Durability** - Changes persist even after system failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding the Role of SQL\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to interact with relational databases. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete data (CRUD operations).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic SQL Commands:\n",
    "1. **Data Definition Language (DDL)** - Defines database structure.\n",
    "   - `CREATE TABLE` - Creates a new table.\n",
    "   - `ALTER TABLE` - Modifies an existing table.\n",
    "   - `DROP TABLE` - Deletes a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Manipulation Language (DML)** - Manages data within tables.\n",
    "   - `INSERT INTO` - Adds new records.\n",
    "   - `UPDATE` - Modifies existing records.\n",
    "   - `DELETE` - Removes records.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Query Language (DQL)** - Retrieves data.\n",
    "   - `SELECT` - Fetches data from a table.\n",
    "   - `WHERE` - Filters records.\n",
    "   - `ORDER BY` - Sorts results.\n",
    "   - `GROUP BY` - Aggregates data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Control Language (DCL)** - Controls access permissions.\n",
    "   - `GRANT` - Assigns privileges.\n",
    "   - `REVOKE` - Removes privileges.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Transaction Control Language (TCL)** - Manages transactions.\n",
    "   - `COMMIT` - Saves changes.\n",
    "   - `ROLLBACK` - Reverts changes.\n",
    "   - `SAVEPOINT` - Creates intermediate checkpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example SQL Queries\n",
    "### Creating a Table:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Students (\n",
    "    id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    age INT,\n",
    "    department VARCHAR(50)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inserting Data:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO Students (id, name, age, department)\n",
    "VALUES (1, 'Alice', 20, 'Computer Science');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieving Data:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM Students WHERE age > 18;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Updating Records:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "UPDATE Students SET department = 'Mathematics' WHERE id = 1;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deleting Records:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DELETE FROM Students WHERE id = 1;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Understanding relational databases and SQL is crucial for managing structured data efficiently. SQL provides powerful commands to create, manipulate, and retrieve data while ensuring data integrity and security.\n",
