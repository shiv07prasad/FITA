    "# NumPy in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with mathematical functions to operate on these data structures efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing NumPy\n",
    "To install NumPy, use the following command:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "pip install numpy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating Arrays\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a 1D array\n",
    "arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n",
    "print(arr)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a 2D array\n",
    "arr2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])\n",
    "print(arr2d)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Array Operations\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Element-wise addition\n",
    "print(arr1 + arr2)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Element-wise multiplication\n",
    "print(arr1 * arr2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common NumPy Functions\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n",
    "print(np.mean(arr))  # Mean\n",
    "print(np.sum(arr))   # Sum\n",
    "print(np.max(arr))   # Max value\n",
    "print(np.min(arr))   # Min value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 1: Create a NumPy array\n",
    "**Task:** Create a NumPy array containing numbers from 10 to 50.\n",

    "arr = np.arange(10, 51)\n",
    "print(arr)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 2: Reshape an array\n",
    "**Task:** Reshape a NumPy array of size 9 into a 3x3 matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "arr = np.arange(9).reshape(3, 3)\n",
    "print(arr)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 3: Perform arithmetic operations\n",
    "**Task:** Given two NumPy arrays `arr1 = np.array([2, 4, 6])` and `arr2 = np.array([1, 3, 5])`, perform element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "arr1 = np.array([2, 4, 6])\n",
    "arr2 = np.array([1, 3, 5])\n",
    "\n",
    "print(arr1 + arr2)  # Addition\n",
    "print(arr1 - arr2)  # Subtraction\n",
    "print(arr1 * arr2)  # Multiplication\n",
